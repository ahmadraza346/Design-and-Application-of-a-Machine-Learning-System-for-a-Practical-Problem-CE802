# Design-and-Application-of-a-Machine-Learning-System-for-a-Practical-Problem-CE802

 In the first part of this project, a pilot study has been conducted for a restaurant predicting profit/losses at a specific location. The study Involved predictive tasks to be performed, identifying features acting as good predictors, defining the learning procedures and evaluation methods.
 
 Second part of the project includes implementing supervised learning classification models shortlisted in the pilot-study and compared their results based on the accuracy, precision, recall and F1. These models include SVM, KNN, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier. It was learnt that every model has its own advantages and disadvantages and performance varies while using different datasets.
 
 In the part 3 of assignment, supervised learning regression models were implemented and their results were compared based on the co-efficient of determination and root mean square error.
